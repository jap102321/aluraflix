This is the final project for ONE Oracle and Alura courses aliance where the main objective was to reaffirm the React knowledge that we saw in the courses.

<h2 align="center">Insight of the project</h2>

This project it's being the manager of a streaming service like Netflix/Prime and others, you can add, remove and edit info about the movies/courses that you want to modify in the project itself.

In my specific design I tried to add movies instead of courses because in my opinion it is way more showy than a courses platform, but its possible to adapt it to any video watching service.
